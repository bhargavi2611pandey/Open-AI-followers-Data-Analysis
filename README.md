# 📊 OpenAI Instagram Followers Data Analysis (Pure Python)

This mini project focuses on real-world data cleaning and analysis using **pure Python (no external libraries)**.  
The dataset is based on **raw Instagram follower data of OpenAI**, which was manually collected and processed into a structured and meaningful format.

The entire project was developed using **Anaconda Navigator with Jupyter Lab**.

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how raw, unstructured social media data can be transformed into useful insights using only core Python programming.

This project performs:
- Text data parsing  
- Data cleaning  
- Data structuring (JSON)  
- Data analysis  

without using any external libraries like pandas, numpy, or regex.

## 📁 Data Pipeline

The data goes through the following stages:

1. **Raw Instagram data** (text format)
2. **Cleaning & chunking**
3. **Structured conversion into JSON**
